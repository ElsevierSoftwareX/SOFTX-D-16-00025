The input Bosonic and Self energy susceptibility have to be normalized in order to
obtain the physical observables. The input data is normalized to obey the constraints of
the code (See instructions.txt).

Bosonic:
	Multiply the output data with -omega*G(0)/2
where G(0) = -8.062557845E-1

Self energy (Sm_m): 
	Multiply the output data with 2.32129226.
